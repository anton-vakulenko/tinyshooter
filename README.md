# TinyShooter

Simple GUI utility for shooting astrophoto with DSLR cameras. Supports dithering (via [PHD2](https://openphdguiding.org/)) and saving images to PC (Canon EOS only). 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Theoretically any modern DSLR camera with Bulb port (saving to PC works on Canon EOS only). 

RS-232 serial port or USB-to-serial port adapter cable using RTS or DTS line. DIY examples of such cables could be found [here](http://www.beskeen.com/projects/dslr_serial/dslr_serial.shtml).

[Microsoft .NET Framework 3.5](https://www.microsoft.com/en-US/download/details.aspx?id=22)

[PHD2](https://openphdguiding.org/) (for interframe dithering feature only)

Edsdk.dll from [Canon EDSDK](https://www.didp.canon-europa.com/) (for saving to PC feature only)

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

Say what the step will be

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
